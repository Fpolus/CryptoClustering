# Cryptocurrency Clustering with K-Means and PCA

This repository contains code and analysis for clustering cryptocurrencies using the K-Means algorithm and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The analysis is conducted on the original data and then compared with results obtained after reducing the dimensionality using PCA.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to cluster cryptocurrencies based on their price change percentages over a specific time period using K-Means clustering. Additionally, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and improve clustering accuracy.

## Elbow Method and Clustering with Original Data

### 1. Elbow Method

To determine the optimal number of clusters (k), the elbow method was implemented. The range of k was set from 1 to 11, and the inertia values were plotted to find the "elbow point."

### 2. Clustering with Original Data

The K-Means model was initialized with the best value for k obtained from the elbow method. The clusters were predicted and added as a new column to the original data. A scatter plot was generated using hvPlot, with points colored by the cluster labels.

## Clustering Optimization with PCA

### 3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

A PCA model with three components was created to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. The explained variance was analyzed to understand the contribution of each principal component.

### 4. Elbow Method with PCA Data

The elbow method was applied to the PCA data to find the optimal k for clustering. The inertia values were plotted to visualize the elbow point.

### 5. Clustering with PCA Data

The K-Means model was initialized with the optimal k from PCA. The clusters were predicted and added to the PCA data. A scatter plot was generated using hvPlot to visualize the clusters.

## Visualizing and Comparing Results

Composite plots were created to compare the elbow curves and cluster results obtained from the original data and PCA. The impact of using fewer features for clustering was analyzed visually.
